# byte 3 Transition dest type (see constants/transitions.s).

# Reminder for warp source content :
# byte 0 is misc data for the warp (shouldn't be touched ?)

# byte 2 is the Warp dest index of the warp (is modified)
# byte 3 (first halfbyte) is the warp group of destination (is modified)
# byte 3 (second halfbyte) is the transition type (shouldn't be touched ?)
